This project uses fictional company as this project is solely used for university assignments. In this project, I created a website appearance using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is made to promote and sell products that are related to technology, including mouse, keyboard, and headset. 
There are 5 main web pages, consisting of:
- “Home” which contains Go Litech expertise as well as banner and slogan.
- “About Us” which contains the story of Go Litech
- “Our Products” which contains images, details, and prices of the products.
- “Our Store” which contains a map and offline stores.
- “Membership” which requires users to fill in personal information to become a Go Litech member
